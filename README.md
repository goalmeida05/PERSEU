# PERSEUcpp
PERSEUcpp: A machine learning strategy to predict cell-penetrating peptides and their uptake efficiency


Our source code is titled PERSEU.py, and in it, you will find how the all descriptors calculations were done and how the model was trained.

To run Perseu CPP, you only need to enter the path of the desired file. For example, if you have the file cpps-test.fasta, simply enter its full name and submit it. The CPPs and their respective efficiencies will be predicted.

The model accepts both FASTA and CSV files. For the FASTA format, you must follow the standard FASTA file structure. For the CSV format, the file should contain a single column with only the sequences.
